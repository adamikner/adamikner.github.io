                    <p>PawPals is an interactive app where users can match with available shelter animals, mostly cats and dogs. Users create in depth profiles about themselves, and the app uses this information to match them with eligible animals for a best fit. Once matched, users are given more information on the shelter animal, and how they can begin the adoption process. The app will also provide information on local resources (shelters, vets, services, etc,) and events going on within their communities.
                    </p>



                    <p>Designed in collaboration with Elizabeth Pozzuoli at the University of Miami in 2017, PawPals was inspired by an assignment in a user experience and interaction design course. The prompt was to "design for good," and PawPal's goals are to reduce the number of animals in shelters while also increasing long-term/permanent adoptions.</p>



                    <p>Throughout the semester, we went through the iterative design process to give PawPals the best user experience possible. Starting with user research and interviews, we collected data, drafted sitemaps and initial designs, and consistently responded to expert feedback and critiques regarding usability errors.</p>

                    <p>At the end of the semester, we created an interactive prototype of PawPals using Adobe Illustrator and Invision. Test it out on the left, and check some the most prominent features by creating a new account, completing your questionnaire, and reviewing your matches! Make sure to say hi to Mustard!</p>

                        <p>Furthing my digital design experience beyond HTML and CSS, I have also taken a course on P5JS, which is a strain of Processing aimed at artists and designers. For my class project, I created an interactive piano memory game based on the simple "simon says" concept. The user hits the start button, and a pattern is played on the keyboard. Once the sequence is done playing, the user must repeat the pattern by clicking on the keys in the same order. It can be harder than you think, give it a try!
