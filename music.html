                        <p> As someone who has always been on the creative side of the music industry, I naturally gravitate towards creators. Through my songwriting minor at the University of Miami, I've been able to surround myself with brilliant writers, while also learning the process, and what can make or break a song.</p>

                        <p>Although I do not want to pursue songwriting as a professional career, I love jumping into the creative process, and working with friends on their various projects. Below is a set of demos that I've contributed to through the A&amp;R process.
                         I love working in a variety of genres, but my strongsuits are Pop, RnB, and Country/Folk. </p>

                        <p>Last October, I started managing Loren Cole. An impressive songstress with a pure voice,
Loren Cole delivers catchy melodies alongside lyrics that search for meaning through a heartfelt perspective. Drawing inspiration from songwriter classics like Carole King and Bob Dylan, Lorenâ€™s music is comparable to the likes of Jason Mraz and Brandi Carlile.</p>
                        
                        <p><i>For The Sake Of Being Honest</i>, Loren's debut album will be released in May 2018! The lead singles "Often," and "Play Me A Song," are available everywhere now.</p>
