                        <p> I started writing songs in my bedroom when I was 14. At the time, it felt like I had truly stumbled into the closet thing I knew of to magic - creating something out of thin air that carries the power to affect and change people. To me, songwriting isn't a hobby or activity, it's a lifestyle that defines who I am. Throughout the years, I've continued to hone my craft through music camps, studying songwriting at the University of Miami, and spending my summers jumping into the co-writing circuits in Nashville. </p>

                        <p>Below is a set of demos of some of my favorite songs that I have recently written. I wrote some songs alone and am featured as the vocalist, and others I cowrote with different writers who are noted in the track title. I love working in a variety of genres, but my strongsuits are Pop, RnB, and Country/Folk. </p>

                        <p>This past October, I started managing Loren Cole. An impressive songstress with an honest voice, Loren Cole delivers clever melodies alongside lyrics that search for meaning through a heartfelt perspective. Based in Los Angeles, Loren is often compared to Missy Higgins or Patty Griffin, and her wide-array of influences range from the darker tones of Mat Kearney and Brandi Carlile, to the lighter music of Jack Johnson and Jason Mraz.</p>
                        
                        <p>"Often," the lead single from her debut album, <i>For The Sake Of Being Honest</i>, will be released in January 2018!</p>
